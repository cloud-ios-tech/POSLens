/// @discussion Value is resolved lazy on demand. It is possible to have POSLens object

///             receive notification after value addition.

/// @brief      Signal which emits actual values.
///             It notifies about property addition, update, and removal.
///
/// @discussion Updates propagate recursively from children to parents. Update of the child
///             object means that its parent is updated as well. The opposite statement is not
///             true in general. For example, let's consider that we have root object Root.
///             Root has two properties A and B. Each property has two children A1, A2 and B1 and
///             B2 correspondently. When B2 property instance is added, updated or removed then
///             signals of B2, B, and Root objects will emit actual values. At the same time
///             the signals of A1, A2, and A objects will be quiet despite that their parent was updated.
///
///             If the property doesn't exist or it was removed, then the signal
///             will emit nil or default value if exist.
///
/// @remarks    Signal emits actual POSLensValue on subscription.
///
///             Signal emits values on the updating thread.
